## Project Overview

This project documents my self-directed learning journey into embodied artificial intelligence. Rather than a traditional development project, this represents my structured exploration of the field, focusing on understanding how intelligent behavior emerges from physical interaction with the environment.

### Learning Objectives:

- Build a solid foundation in embodied AI core algorithms
- Explore vision-language-action models for robot control
- Learn robotic learning techniques for manipulation and navigation
- Study multi-agent systems and emergent behaviors
- Gain experience with simulation environments for embodied AI research

## Learning Path Structure

My study is organized around these core areas:

### 1. Foundation Algorithms
Learning the fundamental algorithms that power embodied AI systems, including reinforcement learning, imitation learning, model predictive control, and diffusion models for robotics.

### 2. Vision-Language-Action Integration
Exploring models that integrate perception, language understanding, and action generation for robot control, with a focus on large multimodal models that can follow instructions in physical environments.

### 3. Robotics & Simulation
Studying manipulation and navigation techniques across various environments, with particular attention to sim-to-real transfer learning. This includes working with simulation environments like MuJoCo, Isaac Gym, and Habitat.

### 4. Multi-Agent Systems
Investigating coordination mechanisms and emergent behaviors in multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios.

## Implementation Exercises

The learning process includes implementing key algorithms and running experiments in simulation:

```python
# Example: Simple reinforcement learning agent in a physical environment
import gym
import numpy as np
from stable_baselines3 import PPO

# Create a simulated robot environment
env = gym.make('FetchReach-v1')

# Initialize the learning agent
model = PPO('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1)

# Training loop
model.learn(total_timesteps=50000)

# Test the trained agent
obs = env.reset()
for _ in range(1000):
    action, _states = model.predict(obs)
    obs, rewards, dones, info = env.step(action)
    env.render()
    
    if dones:
        obs = env.reset()
```

## Learning Resources

My learning is guided by these key resources:

- **[Embodied-AI-Guide](https://github.com/tianxingchen/Embodied-AI-Guide)** - A comprehensive guide to embodied AI research (4.6k+ stars)
- **[Embodied-AI-Paper-List](https://github.com/Lumina-EAI/Embodied-AI-Paper-List)** - A curated collection of important research papers
- **[Awesome-Embodied-AI-Job](https://github.com/StarCycle/Awesome-Embodied-AI-Job)** - Resource tracking research opportunities

Additionally, I follow papers from major conferences like ICRA, CoRL, NeurIPS, CVPR, and ICLR that focus on embodied AI.

## Research Questions

Throughout this learning journey, I'm particularly interested in these questions:

- How do robots develop intelligence through interaction with their environment?
- What mechanisms allow multiple agents to self-organize and develop specialized roles?
- How do AI systems automatically decompose complex tasks and collaborate using specialized tools?
- What role does physical embodiment play in developing robust and generalizable intelligence?

## Project Status

This is an ongoing learning process (as of June 2024) that represents my personal exploration of the field. I'm currently focusing on reinforcement learning foundations and simulation environments for robot learning.
