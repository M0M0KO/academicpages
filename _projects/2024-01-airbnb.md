## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting Airbnb rental prices in New York City based on various property features and location data. By applying data analysis and machine learning techniques, I aimed to understand the factors influencing pricing and develop a predictive model for estimating appropriate listing prices.

### Project Objectives:

- Perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset of over 48,000 Airbnb listings in NYC
- Identify key factors that influence the pricing of short-term rentals
- Develop visualizations to reveal pricing patterns across different neighborhoods
- Implement and optimize machine learning models to predict listing prices

## Data Analysis Process

The analysis workflow involved several key steps:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
I began by exploring the dataset to understand the distribution of prices, property types, and other key features. This included statistical analysis and visualization of price distributions across different boroughs and neighborhoods.

### 2. Geospatial Analysis
Using Python GIS libraries, I created maps to visualize the spatial distribution of listings and identify high-value areas. This helped reveal how location factors such as proximity to landmarks and public transportation affect pricing.

### 3. Feature Engineering
To improve model performance, I transformed categorical variables, created new features (such as distance metrics to key attractions), and engineered seasonal factors that capture temporal pricing patterns.

### 4. Model Implementation
I implemented a RandomForest regression model to predict continuous listing prices, and optimized hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed several insights:

- Manhattan properties command significantly higher prices (average 65% premium) compared to other boroughs
- Properties within 500 meters of subway stations show a 15-20% price premium
- The number of reviews and host experience have a significant but non-linear relationship with pricing
- Seasonal factors can cause price fluctuations of up to 30% for the same property

## Technical Implementation

```python
# Feature engineering example: Creating location-based features
def create_location_features(df):
    # Calculate distance to nearest subway station
    subway_stations = pd.read_csv('nyc_subway_stations.csv')
    
    for idx, row in df.iterrows():
        # Find closest subway station
        distances = []
        for _, station in subway_stations.iterrows():
            dist = haversine(
                (row['latitude'], row['longitude']),
                (station['latitude'], station['longitude'])
            )
            distances.append(dist)
        
        df.loc[idx, 'distance_to_subway'] = min(distances)
        
    # Create neighborhood density feature
    neighborhood_counts = df['neighborhood'].value_counts()
    df['neighborhood_density'] = df['neighborhood'].map(neighborhood_counts)
    
    # Encode neighborhoods by average price
    neighborhood_avg_price = df.groupby('neighborhood')['price'].mean()
    df['neighborhood_price_level'] = df['neighborhood'].map(neighborhood_avg_price)
    
    return df
```

## Results

The RandomForest regression model achieved an RÂ² score of 0.78 on the test dataset, demonstrating strong predictive capability for Airbnb prices. The most influential features were:

1. Location (neighborhood)
2. Property type and size
3. Number of amenities
4. Host experience level

## Technical Stack
