## Abstract

This research utilized machine learning algorithms to analyze and identify exosome features associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. The study revealed distinctive patterns that could potentially serve as biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of the disease.

## My Contribution

Developed machine learning algorithms for exosome feature analysis and classification in hepatocellular carcinoma research.
