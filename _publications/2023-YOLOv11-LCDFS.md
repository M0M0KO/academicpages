## Abstract

Smoking detection in real-world environments faces significant challenges, particularly in low-light conditions where standard detection models often fail. This paper introduces YOLOv11-LCDFS (Low-light Condition Detection For Smoking), a novel approach that combines low-light image enhancement techniques with an optimized YOLO architecture. The model integrates a preprocessing module specifically designed to address the challenges of low illumination, significantly improving detection accuracy in challenging lighting conditions.

## My Contribution

Led the development of the YOLOv11-LCDFS architecture, designed the low-light enhancement preprocessing module, and conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the model's performance across diverse lighting conditions.
