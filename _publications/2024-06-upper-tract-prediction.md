## Abstract

Temporarily unavailable

## My Contribution

**Co-first author (third position)**: Designed and implemented the deep learning architecture for analyzing multi-phase CT images. Developed methods for integrating imaging features with clinical data to create a comprehensive survival prediction model for upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Participated in model validation and performance optimization.
