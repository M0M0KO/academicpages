## Abstract

Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) has a poor prognosis, with nearly 60% of cases being invasive at diagnosis. This study aimed to develop and validate a deep learning model that combines multi-phase CT images and clinical data for improved survival prediction in patients with localized UTUC. The model demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional clinical models, offering potential for more accurate risk stratification and personalized treatment planning.

## My Contribution

Assisted in developing the deep learning architecture for multi-phase CT image analysis and integrating it with clinical data for a comprehensive prediction model.
