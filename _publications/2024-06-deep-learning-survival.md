## Abstract

This study presents a deep learning model for survival prediction in patients with localized upper tract urothelial carcinoma. The model integrates multi-phase CT images with clinical data to provide more accurate prognostic information, potentially improving treatment planning and patient management.

## My Contribution

Developed deep learning models for integrating multi-phase CT images and clinical data, focusing on survival prediction in urothelial carcinoma.

## Status

Submitted to BMC Cancer (June 24, 2024), currently under review.
