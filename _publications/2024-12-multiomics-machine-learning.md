## Abstract

This study integrates multi-omics data with advanced machine learning approaches to develop a CD8+ T cell heterogeneity score for improved prognosis. The research provides valuable insights into immune cell heterogeneity and its impact on disease outcomes.

## My Contribution

Implemented and optimized multiple machine learning algorithms (LASSO, RF, GB, KNN, SVM, GBM, XGBoost, DT) for key gene identification in HNSCC research.
