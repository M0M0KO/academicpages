## Abstract

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a highly aggressive urological malignancy with limited therapeutic options. This study integrates multi-omics data analysis and machine learning approaches to identify a novel regulatory axis involving SRD5A3-AS1/hsa-let-7e-5p/RRM2 in the context of fatty acid metabolism. Our findings reveal potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets that could significantly impact patient outcomes.

## My Contribution

Applied multiple machine learning algorithms to analyze multi-omics data, identifying key molecular features and contributing to the computational validation of the discovered regulatory axis.
